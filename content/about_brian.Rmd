Hi! My name is Brian Connor, and I am a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania. Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree in [Behavioral and Decision Sciences](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/lps/graduate/mbds). I hope to use insights from this program to incorporate realistic expectations about human behavior into my future quantitative work. I am also a proud alumnus of [The College of New Jersey](https://business.tcnj.edu/), where I graduated in May 2017 with a B.S. in Economics. During the day, I work full-time as a Financial Analyst in the Division of Recreation and Intercollegiate Athletics at Penn.

Outside of the classroom and office, I remain highly interested and involved in politics. During the 2018 cycle, I volunteered as a data analyst for [Mikie Sherrill's](https://mikiesherrill.com/) victorious congressional campaign. In this role, I collaborated with staffers to organize and analyze internal and public campaign finance data, using my quantitative skills to draw actionable inferences. In the past, I've interned for [Senator Cory Booker](https://www.booker.senate.gov/) and [KIPP New Jersey](http://kippnj.org/), and I also volunteered as a campus organizer for [Governor Phil Murphy's](https://www.murphy4nj.com/) successful inaugural run.

My current work focuses on the use of data science and behavioral science to develop fresh insights in the field of electoral politics. At the moment, I'm working on a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the relationship between campaign spending and vote share in congressional elections.
