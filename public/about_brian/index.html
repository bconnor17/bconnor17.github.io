<p>Hi! My name is Brian Connor, and I am a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania. Currently, I am pursuing my master’s degree in <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/lps/graduate/mbds">Behavioral and Decision Sciences</a>. I hope to use insights from this program to incorporate realistic expectations about human behavior into my future quantitative work. I am also a proud alumnus of <a href="https://business.tcnj.edu/">The College of New Jersey</a>, where I graduated in May 2017 with a B.S. in Economics. During the day, I work full-time as a Financial Analyst in the Division of Recreation and Intercollegiate Athletics at Penn.</p>
<p>Outside of the classroom and office, I remain highly interested and involved in politics. During the 2018 cycle, I volunteered as a data analyst for <a href="https://mikiesherrill.com/">Mikie Sherrill’s</a> victorious congressional campaign. In this role, I collaborated with staffers to organize and analyze internal and public campaign finance data, using my quantitative skills to draw actionable inferences. In the past, I’ve interned for <a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/">Senator Cory Booker</a> and <a href="http://kippnj.org/">KIPP New Jersey</a>, and I also volunteered as a campus organizer for <a href="https://www.murphy4nj.com/">Governor Phil Murphy’s</a> successful inaugural run.</p>
<p>My current work focuses on the use of data science and behavioral science to develop fresh insights in the field of electoral politics. At the moment, I’m working on a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the relationship between campaign spending and vote share in congressional elections.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in working together, please don’t hesitate to send me an email at brianjconnor17 (at) gmail (dot) com.</p>
